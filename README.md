To run the test problem, use the command

python bin/proglan examples/wire-test.prog

All of the possible inputs are present within the file, but commented out.
To run another combination, simply uncomment the desired line. Note that
Python-style line comments are used.

Also note that the import function is used, which inserts the contents of 
examples/wire.prog verbatim into the file. Also, note that wire.prog imports
priority-queue.prog. It's there. I promise.
